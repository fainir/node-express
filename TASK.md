## Instructions

- Create new folder called 'backend' inside your Todo App<!-- - [Create new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/managing-branches) -->
- Make changes to the code to meet project's requirements 📝
- [Commit Early, Push Often](https://www.worklytics.co/commit-early-push-often/) - your work will be evaluated by your push history 📖
- Good Luck! 🤘

## Guidelines


Create JSONBIN like Restful API using NodeJS + ExpressJS for to do list app with 5 entry points:
Each object like task will be saved as a Json file and each new collection has its own folder.

-   a GET request to /b returns a list of objects

-   a GET request to /b/{id} returns the details of the object 123

-   a POST request to /b create new object and return the new  object (should include unique id)

-   a PUT request to /b/{id} get in the body params updated object and return the updated object

-   a DELETE request to /b/{id} delete a object

make changes to your client:
- have delete and update functionallity
- load data from your new rest api
- save your changes to the rest api whenever you make changes like adding, deleting and updating tasks.
